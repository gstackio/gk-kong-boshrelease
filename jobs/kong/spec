  # tls.protocols:
  #   description: |
  #     Space separated list of protocols to support.
  #     Not yet implemented.
  #   example: "TLSv1.2"
  tls.ciphers:
    description: |
      OpenSSL formatted list of ciphers to support. This applies to both proxy
      and admin TLS endpoints.

      When this property is not set, then the 'modern' cipher suite is used.

      See also: https://docs.konghq.com/0.14.x/configuration/#ssl_cipher_suite
    example: |
      ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256



  client_body_buffer_size:
    description: |
      Defines the buffer size for reading the request body.

      If the client request body is larger than this value, the body will be
      buffered to disk. When the body is buffered to disk Kong plugins that
      access or manipulate the request body may not work.

      It is advisable to set this value as high as possible. But high-
      concurrency environments will require significant memory allocations to
      process many concurrent large request bodies, though.

      See also: https://docs.konghq.com/0.14.x/configuration/#client_body_buffer_size
    default: 8k

  trusted_ips:
    description: |
      A list of CIDR blocks that defines trusted IP address blocks that are
      known to send correct 'X-Forwarded-*' headers.

      Requests from trusted IPs make Kong forward their 'X-Forwarded-*'
      headers upstream. Non-trusted requests make Kong insert its own
      'X-Forwarded-*' headers.

      See also: https://docs.konghq.com/0.14.x/configuration/#trusted_ips
    default: []
    example: [ "0.0.0.0/0", "::/0" ]

  datastore.db_update_frequency_in_sec:
    description: |
      This value determines the frequency at which your Kong nodes will be
      polling the database for invalidation events.

      A lower value will mean that the polling job will be executed more
      frequently, but that your Kong nodes will keep up with changes you
      apply. A higher value will mean that your Kong nodes will spend less
      time running the polling jobs, and will focus on proxying your
      traffic.

      See: https://docs.konghq.com/0.14.x/clustering/#1-db_update_frequency-default-5s
    default: 5

  extra_plugins:
    description: |
      Extra plugins to be loaded by Kong. The 'bundled' plugins are always
      loaded.

      See: https://docs.konghq.com/0.14.x/configuration/#plugins
    default: []

  extra_plugin_packages:
    description: |
      Extra BOSH packages to consider for loading LUA plugins.

      For each extra package, the '/var/vcap/packages/{package}/share/lua/5.1'
      directory will be added to the LUA path and taken into account when
      loading LUA plugins.

      See: https://docs.konghq.com/0.14.x/configuration/#lua_package_path
    default: []
