# Gstack BOSH Release for Kong CE

This BOSH Release is the fastest way to get up and running with a cluster of
[Kong CE][kong_ce] API Gateway when you're using [BOSH][bosh_io].

You are provided here with all the necessary binaries, configuration
templates, and startup scripts for _converging_ Kong clusters (i.e. installing
and updating over time) on Ubuntu Xenial nodes. Plus, we also provide here a
standard [deployment manifest][depl_manifest] to help you deploy your first
Kong API Gateway easily.

[bosh_io]: https://bosh.io/
[kong_ce]: https://konghq.com/kong-community-edition/
[depl_manifest]: ./deploy/kong.yml



## Usage

This repository includes base manifests and operator files. They can be used
for initial deployments and subsequently used for updating your deployments.

```
git lfs version   # check that you have the 'git-lfs' extension
git clone https://github.com/gstackio/gk-kong-boshrelease.git

export BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=<bosh-alias>
export BOSH_DEPLOYMENT=kong
bosh deploy gk-kong-boshrelease/deploy/kong.yml
```

If your BOSH does not have Credhub/Config Server (but it should), then
remember to use `--vars-store` to allow generation of passwords and
certificates.



### Update

When new versions of `gk-kong-boshrelease` are released, the `deploy/kong.yml`
file is updated. This means you can easily `git pull` and `bosh deploy` to
upgrade.

```
export BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=<bosh-alias>
export BOSH_DEPLOYMENT=kong
cd gk-kong-boshrelease
git pull
bosh deploy "deploy/kong.yml"
```



### Clustering

Horizontal scaling works out of the box, with a mere updating of the
[`instances:` property][instances_prop] in the deployment manifest. Kong nodes
will synchronize their state on the shared PostgreSQL database, with
[some caching implemented][db_update_frequency_doc].

Please note though, that the default deployment manifest doesn't provide you
with any High Availability (HA) or horizontal scaling solution for the
PostgreSQL database. If you stick to it, this will still be a single point of
failure.

If you are concerned with HA design for Kong, we encourage you to have a look
at the [Cassandra BOSH Release][cassandra_release] that we're also
contributing to.

We can also mention here the [CockroachDB BOSH Release][cockroachdb_release]
(CockroachDB is a PostgreSQL-compatible database that is designed to be
clustered for High Availability), that has a working BOSH deployment
[in our Easy Foundry distribution][cockroachdb_gbe_spec].

## Design notes

This is a reboot verion of the [Kong CE BOSH Release][kong_ce_release] which
in turn was a fork of the community's [Kong release][kong_release].

As [explained in the fork][design_notes], we have abandonned the non-hermetic,
non-reproducible, and thus non-production-ready Docker design.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! See in our [open issues](./issues) the possible
improvements that you could contribute to. They are prioritized by
[milestones](./milestones) that each expose a specific goal.

As a notice to release authors that contribute here, this BOSH Release is
based on a [Git LFS blobstore][git-lfs-blobstore]. This is quite uncommon, so
please read [Ruben Koster's post][git-lfs-blobstore] first before continuing.

Blobs can be commited to Git here because they are backed by Git LFS. Using
`bosh sync-blobs` is thus no more necessary because you get the correct final
blobs with a mere `git pull`.

Whenever you need to update the blobs, you'll find in the
`scripts/add-blobs.sh` script the way we have been fetching them. This helps
in fetching any newer versions of the softwares, and brings more tracability
as to where the blobs hav been downloaded from.
