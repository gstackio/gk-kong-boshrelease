        # Notes on the build configuration:
        #
        # - The 5 standard options are recommended from then main Kong build
        #   documentation at <https://docs.konghq.com/install/source/>
        #
        # - The last 3 options are recommended at the very end of the
        #   documentation for OpenResty Patches for Kong, available at
        #   <https://github.com/kong/openresty-patches#how-to-apply-patches-manually>
        #
        # - '--with-stream_realip_module' is recommended as of OpenResty v1.11.4.x
        #   '--with-stream_ssl_preread_module' is recommended as of OpenResty v1.11.5.x
        #   See: <https://github.com/Kong/openresty-build-tools/blob/0a84caf/kong-ngx-build#L459-L465>
        #
        # - We choose not to enable IPv6 (--with-ipv6) because as of Oct.
        #   2019, BOSH-managed instances don't play well with IPv6, and BOSH
        #   Stemcells even deactivate it.
        #
        # - We choose not to activate the "Dual-number mode only" option (with
        #   --with-luajit-xcflags="-DLUAJIT_NUMMODE=2") because in BOSH
        #   context, we are supposed to re-compile software for the target
        #   VMs, and make as few assumptions as possible about the underlying
        #   processor architecture, in order to support the widest possible
        #   range. So we let the LuaJIT build system choose the best default
        #   for the "dual-number mode", based on the deteted architecture.
